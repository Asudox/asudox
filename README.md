# Hello there, stranger.
 [I switched to GitLab to try it out for a few months. New repos are available at my GitLab: https://gitlab.com/Asudox]

Nothing much to see here other than my low quality repos.

I know Python.
Currently learning the pain-in-the-ass language called JavaScript because of web development and Rust.

Uh yeah that's all I guess, I don't have much to say. Have a good day.
